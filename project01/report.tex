	\section{Summary}
	\begin{verbatim}
As of right now, everything in my project is working except for the thor.py script and the SIGCHLD handling. I cannot for the life of me 
figure out why SIGCHLD is not a signal that is recognized by my computer. As for the thor.py script, I still need to change up parsing the 
request url so that I can get an accurate path. I did this project alone because my schedule was crazy around the time the project was assigned
and so I got around to asking my friends way too late.  

	\end{verbatim}

	\section{Latency}
	\begin{verbatim}
I tested the throughout return speed by using thor so send 200 requests to the addresses corresponding the files. These are the averages
I obtained. There is not much of a difference as far as I can tell. I believe there may be an issue with my Thor program.

	\section*{Throughout}
	\begin{verbatim}
As there is an issue with my thor.py script, I feel there is no reason to investigate this test. Though if I had been able to, I would have sent
200 processes in 1 request using thor. I then would compare the time differences. Almost inevitably the forking mode should be faster. 
	\end{verbatim}

	\section*{Analysis}
	\begin{verbatim}
Unfortunately I was unable to run the necessary tests to do any real analysis. Had I had more time I would have fixed whatever the issue is 
and run the tests as planned.

	\section{Conclusion}
	\begin{verbatim}
I thought this project was really cool, because it gave me a practical understanding of what is happening when I open a web browser. 
It's fun understanding 'what's under the hood' in a sense. Before this project I had no idea what sockets were, how they functioned, or what was happening every time I made a request to one. Internet security is something I'd like to look into, because it seems like something that would fascinate me, and knowing what is actually happening every time a server is contacted is a fun look into what that kind of work may look like.
